# ChemicalScanner

Have you ever read the ingredients of a packaged good and got lost in all the chemical jargon? Have you ever taken the time to check if those ingredients are safe to eat? Let ChemicalScanner help!

ChemicalScanner/UnWrapped is a web application that parses the list of ingredients of a packaged good and determines if any items are considered as a carcinogen. The application was built by a group of UBC Computer Science students for the 2020 CMD-F Hackathon.
